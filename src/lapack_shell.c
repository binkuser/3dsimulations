           Equation example:
           (1+j)*p1 + (-1)*p2 = j
           (1-j)*p1 + (1+j)*p2 = 1

           Solution:
           p1 = 0.5 + 0.5 j
           p2 = 0

           The rowmajor array should look like:
           (1+j),(-1),(1-j),(1+j)

           The colmajor array should look like:
           (1+j),(1-j),(-1),(1+j)

           The rowmajor format is more familiar to read algabraically.
           However lapack will run faster on colmajor matrices because it has been designed for FORTAN..

           Meaning of variables in the example:
           n is the order of matrix A and the number of rows of B in AxS=B.
           Array a is the input co-efficient representing matrix A of size lda by n (lda: leading dimension of A).
           Array b is the input co-efficient representing matrix of size ldb by nrhs (number of right hand sides).
           For a single circuit square matrix equation normally nrhs=1 and lda=ldb=n.
           The return number generated by LAPACKE_zgsv() indicates any problems, info=0 means OK, otherwise it is the index where the inverse could not be computed.
           The solutions S will be written in b, overwriting the original input of right hand sides.
           The internally used transform matrix will be written in a.
           The internally used pivot indices will be written in the ipvt array.
